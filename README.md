## Introduction

Block-Vote is built using Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain framework. It leverages the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of the voting process.

## Features

- Secure and tamper-proof voting system
- Transparent and auditable voting records
- Permissioned access for participants
- Easy deployment and configuration

## Getting Started

To get started with Block-Vote, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fabric-samples/block-vote.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the network and participants: [link to configuration guide]
4. Start the blockchain network: `./network.sh up`
5. Deploy the smart contract: `./contract.sh deploy`
6. Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, participants can access the voting system through a web interface [TODO]. They can cast their votes, view voting results, and monitor the progress of the election.
